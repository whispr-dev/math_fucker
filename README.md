 some tricksy math for testing out more C++ optimizations

basically an identical endeavour as that contained in the amphichiral_cas_contd. repo but with wayyyy harder math hence requiring much more computation, being slower/more intense computationally and so leaving much more scope for optimization - the whole point of the exercise originally.
